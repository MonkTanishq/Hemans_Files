<span style="font-size:25px;"> Reasons to Study Machine Learning</span>
<br><br>
Before diving in, let’s consider just why you should learn machine learning. 
This isn’t an easy ride, so what makes it worth the effort?
<br>
Here are a few good reasons:
<br><br>
ML Is Future-Proof<br>

AI is not just a passing fad—this is the future. The revolutionary technology in these 
fields is already changing many industries, including healthcare, energy, and marketing.  <br>

According to Forbes, by 2022 there will be 58 million new jobs in AI and machine learning. 
So, if job security is important to you, there’s no safer bet.<br><br>
The World Is Data-Driven<br>
From one-man start-ups to Fortune 500 companies, the world can’t get enough data. 
It has the power to transform a business, letting you learn more about your market, 
your competitors, and your customers. However, that’s only if you have the right 
person for the job. The increasing value of a data scientist or machine learning 
engineer is undeniable now.<br><br>
Big Data, Big Money<br>

Data from Indeed on average salary rates found that machine learning engineers typically 
reel in around $145,000 each year. That’s among the highest salaries in tech, and those 
rates only increase with experience.
<br><br>
Exciting Career Path
<br>
While there is much more to machine learning jobs than building futuristic robots and 
clever programs that will reduce repetitive work, there’s no doubt that exploring the 
most revolutionary technology on our planet is a pretty cool way to make a living. 
It’s full of possibilities, so you’re sure to have fun.
<br>
Since the technology has gone mainstream, more people have been attracted to 
machine learning and AI, even transferring from unrelated fields. However, 
many others are deterred by the idea of expensive and lengthy study routes. 
<br><br>
<span style="font-size:25px;">Learning Path</span><br>
The most logical way to learn machine learning is by starting with the basics, 
then building up your knowledge, one level at a time. By taking a linear approach, 
this will help you reinforce new knowledge, and you should see a steady progression 
in your skills.
<br>
With that in mind, we’ve divided our list of free machine learning resources into 
three core stages:
<br><br>
    Learning<br>
    Practice<br>
    Deployment<br>
<br>
Without further ado, let’s dive in.
<br><br>
<span style="font-size:25px;">Learning</span>
<br>
    <br>

Probability Theory<br>

Probability concepts and conditional probability are vital machine learning basics. 
If you don’t know these topics, you’ll struggle to understand algorithms. 
We recommend you take Khan Academy’s free course on statistics and probability so 
you can build up a sound knowledge of descriptive and inferential statistics.
<br><br>
Statistical Error<br>
Understanding statistical error is essential in order to comprehend machine 
learning algorithms, and also to be able to determine their accuracy. Here’s a visual 
prompt to help you remember the difference between Type I (false positive) errors and 
Type II (false negative) errors.
<br><br>
Linear Algebra<br>
When you want to manipulate large data sets, you’ll need to be good at linear algebra. 
In this post, you’ll find a list of great resources that explain linear algebra in 
relation to machine learning concepts and problems.
<br><br>
Bayesian Inference<br>

If you’ve only started to learn machine learning, 
you may not have encountered Bayesian principles yet. Rest assured, you’ll soon get 
familiar with them—they are a vital part of understanding machine learning. This online 
textbook will kickstart your knowledge of Bayesian statistical principles.
<br><br>
Data Pipelines
<br>
You’ll need to know the fundamentals of data pipelines, and how they process streaming 
data. This is essential to understanding how machine learning works with dynamic data 
sets. Machine Learning Mastery has created a useful tutorial that explains the basics 
of data pipelines.<br><br>
Skills<br>
<br>
Probabilistic Programming<br>
One of the best ways to learn statistical concepts is by actually sitting down to write 
code and play around with functions. This online textbook on “Probabilistic Programming 
& Bayesian Methods for Hackers” puts math in the back seat, making programming the priority 
in an interactive iPython Notebook style that is enjoyable to learn with.
<br><br>
Calculus<br>

A lot of machine learning revolves around function loss and optimizing for these losses. 
Understanding the error rate in machine learning systems is only possible if you have a 
solid knowledge of calculus—specifically multivariate calculus. Check out this simplified 
rundown to get to grips with essential calculus principles.<br>
<br>
Matrix Factorization<br>

When you’re studying math for machine learning, there are several core aspects that 
really require their own dedicated study program. Matrix factorization is one of those 
aspects. This is a critical facet of machine learning implementation, so you must work 
hard to develop your knowledge in this area.<br>
<br>
Algorithms<br>

Every algorithm has its own intricate features and functions. You must understand how 
to use algorithms properly if you’re going to solve any machine learning problems. 
This extensive exploration of machine learning algorithms is a great primer for machine 
learning beginners.<br><br>

Wrangling Data<br>

Quite often, you’ll find data sets that have not been cleaned. Therefore, it’s not easy to 
dive in and start working with them right away. It’s a worthwhile venture to learn how 
to format and collapse data in any format. This article will help you clean and process 
data sets to use in whatever machine learning project you need it for.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:25px;">Practice</span><br>
<br>
After you have solidified your knowledge and basic abilities in machine learning, 
the next stage is to put your skills to the test. You can find different types of datasets here.
<br>

Data sets are essential as they allow your algorithms to learn how to perform text 
classification, mining, and categorization tasks. By accessing data sets and creating 
projects with them, you can develop a solid understanding of software engineering. 
When you implement machine learning at scale, you’ll need to be adept at using distributed 
data tools like Spark and Hadoop. Check out this introduction for frameworks you can use.
<br><br>
Kaggle<br>

All who aspire for a career in machine learning should be familiar with Kaggle. 
In addition to a wealth of resources, Kaggle offers an unrivaled community of people 
studying machine learning. Each of the data sets here is the centerpiece of ongoing 
discussion. It’s easy to jump in and use these resources to create your own projects, 
and many other data scientists have uploaded notebooks dedicated to each data set, 
helping learners with algorithms and specific problems.<br><br>

GitHub<br>

Another stronghold of machine learning education is the GitHub community. 
Here, you’ll find a deep reserve of data sets that have been organized by topics. 
Looking for something to do with education, economics, or biology? You name it, and 
there’s a good chance GitHub has it.<br><br>

Machine Learning Repository<br>

The University of California has done the machine learning community a great 
service with this repository. The School of Information and Computer Science at
UCI currently has over 470 data sets, all of which have been classified by the type 
of problem. Many of these data sets are cleaned, making them easier to use.<br><br>

Amazon<br>

That’s right, Amazon has data sets too. You’ll find them in the Amazon Web Services 
(AWS) resources section. This makes it easy for anyone who is using AWS to experiment 
with machine learning. Similar to GitHub, the data sets here have been categorized by 
various niche topics including ecological resources and public transport.<br><br>

Gengo.AI<br>

The resources here may not be anywhere near as vast as Kaggle, but Gengo.AI has some 
good links to offer for specialist interests. This includes a lot on sentiment analysis, 
natural language processing (NLP), and data sets for autonomous vehicles.<br><br>

Tools<br><br>

Scikit-learn<br>

Over time, you’ll probably need to develop skills in C++ and Java. However, 
for as long as you’re coding in Python, you’ll struggle to find a better tool than 
scikit-learn. This is among the most popular Python libraries for people studying 
machine learning, boasting a vast array of algorithms for classification, preprocessing, 
regression, clustering, and model selection. It’s also user-friendly and full of good 
tutorials and working examples.<br><br>

Microsoft Azure Machine Learning<br>

This cloud platform is a great training ground for developers. You can build and train 
your own AI models here. Microsoft continues to update the platform with new tools and 
improved features. You can sign up for 12 months free.<br><br>

IBM Watson<br>

IBM’s cloud service is designed for users who want to put their machine learning 
models into production. You can use the tool to conduct fundamental operations 
including training and scoring. IBM Watson works best when you are building your 
machine learning applications through an API connection. The “Lite” version is free.<br><br>

TensorFlow<br>

Google uses TensorFlow for research and production purposes. This open-source 
library is full of useful software for dataflow projects and programming. This makes 
it an excellent machine learning framework, especially because of its easy visualization 
of neural networks.
<br><br>
While we think the best way to learn machine learning (or any discipline) is through 
a self-starter approach, you don’t need to go it alone all the way. In fact, it’s much 
better if you actively work with others.
<br>
So, once you’ve built your skills and confidence, it’s time to get involved with 
the wider machine learning community. 
<br><br>
<span style="font-size:25px;">
Machine learning Categorized As</span><br><br>

    Supervised machine learning algorithms can apply what has been learned in the past 
	to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. Starting from the 
	analysis of a known training dataset, the learning algorithm produces an inferred 
	function to make predictions about the output values. The system is able to provide 
	targets for any new input after sufficient training. The learning algorithm can also 
	compare its output with the correct, intended output and find errors in order to modify 
	the model accordingly.<br><br>
    Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the information used to train 
	is neither classified nor labeled. Unsupervised learning studies how systems can infer 
	a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. The system doesn’t 
	figure out the right output, but it explores the data and can draw inferences from 
	datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.<br><br>
    Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms fall somewhere in between supervised 
	and unsupervised learning, since they use both labeled and unlabeled data for training 
	– typically a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. 
	The systems that use this method are able to considerably improve learning accuracy. 
	Usually, semi-supervised learning is chosen when the acquired labeled data requires 
	skilled and relevant resources in order to train it / learn from it. Otherwise, 
	acquiringunlabeled data generally doesn’t require additional resources.<br><br>
    Reinforcement machine learning algorithms is a learning method that interacts 
	with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. Trial 
	and error search and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of 
	reinforcement learning. This method allows machines and software agents to 
	automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context in order 
	to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent 
	to learn which action is best; this is known as the reinforcement signal.<br><br>

Machine learning enables analysis of massive quantities of data. While it generally 
delivers faster, more accurate results in order to identify profitable opportunities 
or dangerous risks, it may also require additional time and resources to train it properly. 
Combining machine learning with AI and cognitive technologies can make it even more 
effective in processing large volumes of information.<br><br>
